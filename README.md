# Border-animation

So Basically, This code creates a fun animation for a product called PORGANIC TANGERINE. When you hover over it, the borders light up like a disco!

First, we have the HTML structure defining the product image and its description.

Then, we jazz it up with CSS! We import some cool fonts and set the stage with a purple background. The product sits in the center with a nice border animation effect when hovered over.

The title wiggles around a bit when you hover over it, like it's dancing to a funky beat. And the description slides over to reveal more details about the tasty treat.

It's like the product is throwing a little party on your screen, inviting you to join in the fun!
